# Grocery-List
Block 6: Workshop: Grocery List
Grocery List Requirements
Your list needs to meet all the following requirements.

Incorporate the major HTML semantic tags.
Each category of grocery should be in some type of "section".
Sections should have background colors.
Section headers should have background colors.
The main header text needs to be a different color.
Use three types of headings.
Include two types of lists.
Use the box model to add borders and spacing to each section.
Add two photos with padding so it is nicely spaced away from the text element.
CSS needs to be incorporated using an external CSS file, internal in the header, and inline. You choose which CSS goes where.
